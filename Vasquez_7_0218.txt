13 Explain this code:
public Animation Playeranime, up, down, left, right, sprite, wait;
   public Player() throws SlickException {
      SpriteSheet running = new SpriteSheet(
                "res/ogrespritesheet.png", 64, 64, 0);
        up = new Animation();
        up.setAutoUpdate(true);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(0, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(1, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(2, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(3, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(4, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(5, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(6, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(7, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(8, 8), 330);
Declared animations, then has a class constructor which initializes the up animation and add the frames
14.Why would it be unrealistic / unproductive  to memorize Slick syntax - what are the skills we were trying to practice?
Memorizing slick syntax is very specific. Rather, we should focus on skills that j=have maximum return on investment (Roi).
Slick is but one library among thousands of java libraries consequently, we are better served by learning skills such as how to decode and implement java libraries.
the important part of what we are doing is problem solving and pattern recognition, i.e., compu
Slick is code that will be replaced by better code then it will happen again so on and so forth
the goal of this class is to get used to reading all code new old so you can solve problems in code and learn new code more quickly
15.What is an array?
array is a ordered list. Containing one data type 
is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
16. how do you make a array?
String[] Michael ={“john”,”sally”,”stormy”];
//this creates an array with 4 different values
int[] MyFavoritNumbers = new int [42];
//creates an integer array with 42 null vaules
17.What is an ArrayList?
An ArrayList can contain multiple data types.
To make an ArryList with a specific type, we use <>
ArrayList<stuff> thing = new ArrayList();
things.add(moreStuff);
18.How do you make an arraylist?
public ArrayList<Trap> protect = new ArrayList();
In Netbeans, make an arraylist. Use autocompletion with the created arraylist (the '.' and pop-up):

19.What are three useful arraylist methods that you identified?

20.What is the difference between an array and an arraylist?
an array is static, i.e., it has a fixed size, whereas ArrayLists are dynamic, i.e., their size can change. 
21.How could we make a health counter for an avatar?
public int player heath =10;
if(playerisHit)[
heath -=1;
