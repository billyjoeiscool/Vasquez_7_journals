Explain this code:
public Animation Playeranime, up, down, left, right, sprite, wait;
    public Player() throws SlickException {
        SpriteSheet runningSS = new SpriteSheet(
                "res/ogrespritesheet.png", 64, 64, 0);
        up = new Animation();
        up.setAutoUpdate(true);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(0, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(1, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(2, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(3, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(4, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(5, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(6, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(7, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(8, 8), 330);
this code add the animation and movemont for any spite and the next tells you 
where to find the pics for the sprite and the rest is where the pic are for and the oder thay should be put in
Why would it be unrealistic / unproductive  to memorize Slick syntax - what are the skills we were trying to practice?
Slick is code that will be repleced by better code then it will happen agin so on and sofroth
the goal of this class is to get used to reading all code new old so you can sovle problems in code and learn new code more quikly
