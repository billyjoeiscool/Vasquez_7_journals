Please describe 3 very specific things you have learned about CS or CS specific problems you have solved working with Arduino.
You should provide AT LEAST 9 sentences worth of detail.
I have learned to check change check in any code to see the probelm is.
like if you don't know if the problem is with the program or the bliuleding so you cheak the program.
If this fine then change the bliuding then repeat.
That class are very important in seperting code. 
You will all ways need it or you will have too much code in one place.
That is not reusable or hader to use.
there is alot of code that needs to be reaseched.You have a good idea if you've been in code for a good amout of time.
You still have no idea how to work with the stuff that already programed in.
Like java code has geared tord ojects that that are fake and you can make 
,but arduino code is codeing a object that already is real so the ounly thing you can change is its own varbles.
