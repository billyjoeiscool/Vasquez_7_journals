Arduino uses a variant of the C programming language.
What differences and similarites have you noticed? Provide at least 3 and explain in complete sentences.
the similarites are the code has tools that are coded in before hand . that both have diffent class and tools and variables and
all so the code is limted be cause this will be on a real life object
What code adaptations have you made? [Or will you make if none to date. Note: 'none' is not a valid answer]
make a chan reacshions like when this happens turn on light then eta
What is required for a circuit?
it has to condot electricity and it all must connect
How are programs compiled with Arduino?
that have comaneds and class already programed in 
Describe the projects you have completed this/last week and what you have learned from them.
Descriptions should be _at least_ one full paragraph in length.
We did the simion that was fun because it made its own order for you to follow. We a light turn on and off using a buttion.
We messed with the light using the senser.We learned how make a circuit.
We learned that you have to veryfy dowload on to the Arduino to put in code.
A it will keep doing that untill you dowload anthor code.
You will be completing your own project
- a project of your own design that accepts user input and provides light and sound in some way.

Describe your project and the code adaptations you will have to make.
[Note - 'none' is not a valid answer. For example, there is a 'Simon' game provided 
- using that code would earn a '0' because it is 0% your code.]
make a chan reacshions like when this happens turn on light then eta
