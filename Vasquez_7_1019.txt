Are you? Why or why not?
I did not have a good grasp on how to use methods with pics.
This is a real question -- describe what you did the days we went over art methods. What did you write? type? What were your thoughts?
I think three I typed Private void drawcricle(GraphicsContext gc, int x,int y,int d) {
gc.setFill(Color.blue);
gc.fillOval(x,y, d,d);
as notes I thought I could work with this
Did you notice that art method code was shared in the journals (as proclaimed with very large text)? Why or why not?
no I just did not notce
Have you examined the sample code on github? Why or why not?
yesbecause it give me anidea on shapes
Write a sample method for making a sequence of red squares on the canvas.
public void (graphics context gc,int i,int j,int u,int s){
gc.fillRect(i,j.u,s)
something like that
