    Create a class for 'Hero'
    The class should contain:
    variables for health, score, power/weapon, dexterity, perception, level, x, y, z, and a symbol
    There should also be a class constructor accepting inputs for name, x, y, and symbol
    Provide an example of initializing a hero object with your name
    Explain why you would not initialize the hero in class hero.
because you wouldn't be able to call hero anywhere else in the project.
