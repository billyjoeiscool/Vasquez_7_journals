  The Slick assignment was intended to gently familiarize you with 2-D arrays. Some students recognized the 2-D arrays from Slick
  and previous journals --- other students had no recollection. Which were you? Why? Note - attributing the environment 
  is not pragmatic - as students experienced the same environment (though they might have experienced it differently)
  I know the basic defneshion for a array low skill on the code side why? I need to have no coding expeance before this year having said that I have learned alot ,but 
  I feel that this cousre was more built around student that have had coding expence out side of class like ksat students and not ones
  that have just started so every day feels like I am playing kachup all the time while some students are farther then others that would be
  fine if there was a way for me to get help from them ,but most are still working on the game which is good for them it ok if the teacher
  was not so busy (for good reasons though) so, all my qusechion have to wait till he can get around to it or I go after school which is
  not possible all the time ether.I suggest a asstnet from this teatcher
  Make a list of ten questions related to the Array assignments pt 1 and 2 - that you predict will be on the 
  semester exam. E.g., object initialization, class constructors, creating and changing arrays, etc.
