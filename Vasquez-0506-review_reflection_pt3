Given mymap[67][43] Which is the x coordinate? Which is the y coordinate? Why? How does this happen?
the x coordinate is [43] and the other coordinate y is [67] why because when put  (int i = 0; i <= map[0].length - 1; i++) that makes i x and you put (int j = 0; j <= map[1].length - 1; j++) to make j y 
Consider:
        for (int i = 0; i <= map[0].length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= map[1].length - 1; j++) {
                if (j < map[1].length - 1) {
                  if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888"); #a
                    } else if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                        System.out.print("."); #e
                    } else {
                        System.out.print(map[i][j]); #b
                    }
                } else {
                    if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                        System.out.println("."); #c
                    } else {
                        System.out.println(map[i][j]); #d
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
        
        
      
Write the code from line #a and explain what it does.
this code prints "8888" every time x coordinate is 0
Write the code from line #b and explain what it does.
prints out the grid of dots
Write the code from line #c and explain what it does. Explain how its different than #e
line c prints dots and line print over everything thats not a x 
Write the code from line #d and explain what it does.
prints a the grid of dots with all the changes we put in
Explain how to use a boolean with a while loop. Provide a very specific use case and code example.
in a game the game is played while play is true and you can change it to false when you lose or win
while (play==true)
lose class {
if ((usery==deathy)&&(userx==userx));
(play==false;)
}
Explain the use of static.
static is useful when you need to call on varbles class easly
Provide an example of how you could use an object with your game. Give a code example
I could put has key when go to this coordies go to door open has key win
door boolean{
for while (dooropen==false);
if (play==haskey)
return (dooropen==true);
